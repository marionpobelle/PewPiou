Pew Piou is a Multiplayer/Shoot'em up game where as migratory birds, you and a friend must each rally as many birds to your travel as possible.
To do so, you must converse with the birds you encounter during your trip and convince them to join you. As a proud oviparous, you obviously want a bigger flock than your friend, so do not hesitate to ruffle their feathers by pushing them around and steal their targets!

# Features

Each player can manipulate their bird in different ways:

- Flying around in every direction allows them to dodge enemy projectiles and catch notes.
- Deploying waves that absorb and deflect enemies notes.
- Rallying birds to your flock, showing your opponent which one of you is the lord of the skies

# How to Play

Each player's goal is to rally more birds to their flock than their competitive player.

Each bird encountered will start the conversation by sending a series of notes ranging from 2 to 3 per sequence. In order to rally a bird to their flock, each player has to parry the last note emitted by said bird with the same colored wave. Parrying notes preceding the rally note will not affect the recruitment of the bird, but will grant the players more points.

The players can each accumulate a total of 3 waves, if they wish to anticipate the incoming notes rather than relying on their reflexes. The player can push each other to steal their targets.

The most notes you gather from one same bird, the more points you'll get. The player that recruited the most allies for its flock to win the competition.

# Development

Pew Piou was made using [Unity](https://unity.com/fr).

It was realized in 4 days as part of our Master's degree curriculum at CNAM-ENJMIN with the following constraints: it had to be a shoot'em up with 2 players, using only 5 inputs in total and the interactive experience must last for 3 minutes.
